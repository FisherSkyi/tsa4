This repo contains the adapted code for the book Time Series Analysis and Its Applications With R Examples by Robert H. Shumway and David S. Stoffer. 

The code has been modified to explore additional concepts and techniques in time series analysis.

For educational purposes only.

## Requirements

Install the `astsa` package in R:

```R
install.packages("astsa")
```

## Acknowledgments

This project makes use of the **astsa** R package by Mike Shumway and David Stoffer  
for datasets and functions related to time series modeling  
(ARIMA, spectral analysis, Kalman filtering, and simulation).

- Package: https://cran.r-project.org/package=astsa  
- Book: *Time Series Analysis and Its Applications* (Shumway & Stoffer)

We gratefully acknowledge the authors for providing the package and the examples  
used in the exploratory analysis and visualizations in this repository.
